# Retail-Sales-Analysis
The purpose of this project is to display beginner SQL skills used by data analysts. For this project, I looked at a retail sales data set from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset?resource=download). Using this dataset, I first cleaned and standardized the column names in Python using Pandas to make them SQL-friendly, then exported the cleaned data as a new CSV. I used SQLAlchemy to import the data into a PostgreSQL database and created a sales table. From there, I performed exploratory data analysis by writing SQL queries to answer business focused questions and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
